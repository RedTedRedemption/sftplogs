# sftplogs
A simple python tool to analyze sftp logs

#Generating files that the program can read
running `journalctl -r > log.log` will generate a file that the program will read and then parse for valid sftp-server entries, but to save analysis time you might
want to run `journalctl -r | grep "sftp-server\[" > log.log` instead.

This program was written on fedora, so your log output format may be different. Please raise an issue if there is a different format for your system and I may address it.

# Installation and usage
Simply download the file and run it with python3. The necessary libraries should be built into Python 3 by default.

If a file is not specified it will ask you to enter the name of one.
You can also specify a file on the command line. Please note that the program assumes you will invoke it in the following format:
`python3 sftpAnalyze.py <filename>`
